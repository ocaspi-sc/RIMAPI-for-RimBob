# RimAPI

RimAPI is a RimWorld mod that embeds a high-performance REST API server directly into the game, allowing external applications to read and interact with your colony in real-time.

RimAPI exposes over **120+ comprehensive endpoints**. The API starts listening on `http://localhost:8765/` by default as soon as the game reaches the main menu.
